# abvote_wordcloud
Wordclouds from Twitter for #abvote 2015.

## Setup

You'll need [R](http://www.r-project.org/), and you'll have to install the dependent libraries (e.g. `install.packages(c("..."))`).

Next, copy `secrets_template.R` to `secrets.R`, and replace the variables with your Twitter API keys.

Run & you should be good to go!
